Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project with you! ðŸš€

In this project, I used the following technologies:

â€¢ React-Bootstrap for responsive UI components
â€¢ Zustand for state management
â€¢ React-Router-Dom for routing
â€¢ React-Icons for beautiful icons

Key Features:
â€¢ User Section with Tabs: Loads content only when clicked for better performance.
â€¢ User Posts and Comments: Easily view user posts and their comments.
â€¢ User Albums: Browse user albums and view details for each album.
â€¢ Favorites Management: Add or remove albums from your favorites directly from the album details page. You can also manage your favorite albums from the favorites page.
